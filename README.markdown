# HummingJay

## Overview

HummingJay is a PHP 5.3+ library for creating REST APIs using the **hm-json** (todo: hm-json needs a stand-alone spec page) format to deliver hypermedia and JSON data to clients. It has methods for routing, hypermedia generation, and handling HTTP methods and HTTP status codes.

## Example

## Version History
